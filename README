== Emergency Manaement

This is a simple app that is supposed to enter patient data into a database and generate a pdf file of it when called to print and send the patient file to the requisite OutPatient department.

== Work Done

* All required models are generated.
* Converted the .erb to .haml.
* Added seeds.

== Work needs  to be done

* Need to work a bit on views to make it pretty.
* Need to generate partials for the three child models to be rendered with the Patient model
* Need to add pdf file generation support.
* Need to figure out tests.
